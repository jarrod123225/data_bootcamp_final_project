# data_bootcamp_final_project
The primary objective of our project was to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 cases/deaths both globally and in the United States with the U.S. Dollar and FAANG stocks. Given that for much of COVID-19 the FAANG stocks primarily carried the US stock market, we considered the FAANGs as an indicator of the market as a whole. The three graphs I primarily analyzed were "World COVID per month and FAANGs," "U.S. COVID and USD," and "Does USD or COVID best explain the FAANG data." My partner Yuan worked on the others. Instead of creating a single, specific question, we wanted to answer a broad array of questions to analyze the relationship in-depth. Thus, we choose "What Relationships Exist Between COVID-19, the FAANGS, and the U.S. Dollar?" When looking through the notebook and slide deck, you will find analysis using line and scatter plots, linear regression, and supervised machine learning techniques.
